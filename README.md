# Test Cases for Random Facts API

| Test Case      | Steps | Expected Results | Validations |
|----------------|-------|------------------|-------------|
| **Test Case 1** - Default params values | 1. Make a GET request to `facts/random/` without providing query params. | 1. Response code is 200. <br> 2. 1 fact object is returned. <br> 3. Fact object is of type "cat". | 1. Verify the response code is 200 (request is successful). <br> 2. Check that the root JSON element is a dictionary (indicating a single fact). <br> 3. Confirm that the `type` field has the value "cat" (ensuring a cat fact is returned). |
| **Test Case 2** - Valid "animal_type" params | 1. Make a GET request to `facts/random/` with "animal_type" query param: <br> - `facts/random/?animal_type=cat` <br> - `facts/random/?animal_type=dog` | 1. Response code is 200. <br> 2. Fact returned corresponds to the specified "animal_type". | 1. Confirm the response code is 200 (request is successful). <br> 2. Check that the root element's `type` field matches the specified "animal_type" query param. |
| **Test Case 3** - Valid "amount" params | 1. Make a GET request to `facts/random/` with "amount" query param: <br> - `facts/random/?amount=0` <br> - `facts/random/?amount=2` <br> - `facts/random/?amount=500` | 1. Response code is 200. <br> 2. A list of facts is received. <br> 3. List contains the specified number of facts according to the "amount" query param. | 1. Confirm the response code is 200 (request is successful). <br> 2. Verify that the root JSON element is a list (indicating multiple facts). <br> 3. Check that the number of items in the list matches the "amount" query param. |
| **Test Case 4** - Invalid "amount" params | 1. Make a GET request to `facts/random/` with "amount" param of 501: <br> - `facts/random/?amount=501` | 1. Response code is 405. <br> 2. Validation message "Limited to 500 facts at a time" is returned. | 1. Check the response code is 405 (request is not successful). <br> 2. Confirm the response message is "Limited to 500 facts at a time". |
| **Test Case 5** - Random facts are returned | 1. Make a GET request to `facts/random/` without query params. <br> 2. Make a second GET request to `facts/random/` without query params. <br> 3. Compare the "text" fields from both responses. | 1. The facts in the two requests are different. | 1. Compare the "text" field from the first and second requests. If they are not equal, the facts are random. |
